0.  BMP - Up to 32-bit per pixel (32bpp) format supports 4,294,967,296 distinct(RGB + alpha) colors
    JPG - 24 bits/pixel, 2^24 = 16 777 216 colors
    GIF - 8 bits/pixel, 256 colors
    PNG - with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA(RGB + alpha) colors
1.  Only the GIF-files support animation
2.  Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not, in the compression of a file, 
    all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed. 
3.  JPG formats is lossy-compressed
4.  If a file is deleted on the FAT file system the first character of a file name is replaced by a special character (0xE5) 
    causing the operating system (Windows, DOS etc.) to ignore the file. Also, all clusters allocated to the file are 
    marked as 'available' in the FAT.
5.  Overwrite all addressable locations with a random character, overwrite against with the characterâ€™s complement,
    and then verify. 
6.  This header defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements, along with macros specifying their limits 
    and macro functions to create values of these types.
7.  Using well-defined types makes the code far easier and safer to port to other platform
8.  BYTE - 1 byte
    DWORD - unsigned 4 bytes
    LONG - signed 4 bytes
    WORD - 2 bytes
9.  BM
10. bfSize - size of file, biSize - size of BITMAPINFOHEADER
11. The order of rows from up to down
12. biBitCount
13. If the file is successfully opened, the function returns a pointer to a FILE object, otherwise, a NULL pointer is returned.
14. Because we read only one block of data at the time
15. 3
16. Sets the position indicator associated with the stream to a new position
17. Current position of the file pointer
18. Rick Astley!!!
